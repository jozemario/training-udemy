<details><summary>NodeJS</summary>
<p>

`NodeJS It’s a cross-platform environment that you can run JavaScript in, particularly for back-end web development built on Chrome’s V8 engine. It’s the backbone of almost all modern JavaScript tooling.`

* ### Features and use case of Node.JS
`Node.js has a variety of use cases as it is designed to support an extensive range of development requirements:`

```
The non blocking and event driven server implementation.
Batch processing scenarios.
Web servers, message servers and APIs (application programming interface).
Event Broadcasting applications such as chats, games and interactive themes.
Windows based server applications.
Microcontroller programming and embedded system programming.
Content Management Systems (CMS) for content publishing.
E-commerce and trade based real time monitoring dashboards.
```
* ### Pros of Node.JS Server

`Powerful tech stack`
`Since Node.js is based on JavaScript, it has access to the JavaScript tech stack and resources. Hence there are multiple frameworks and environments that can be used in development (example: MongoDB, Angular and Express.js).`

```

<details><summary>Golang</summary>
<p>

`Golang is a procedural, multiparadigm, open-source programming language, created by Google developers that were unhappy with the existing languages. C, C++, and Java all failed to manage Google’s large network servers, so they created Go, a language derived from the power and syntax of C and based on safety, simplicity, and speed.`


* ### What Golang Is Used For

```
Golang is mainly a server-side language (used for backend development), although its application area is growing tremendously. Some companies are using it even for front-end development, but that isn’t kind of mainstream for now.

So, what Golang is mainly used for?

As it was created to deal with the modern-day tech challenges, it shows itself best in the following areas:

network programming,
big data,
cloud computing
machine learning,
geofence,
microservices,
audio and video streaming and editing.
```
* ### The Pros

```
Simple to maintain apps since the code is easy to read
Popular with developers because it features a neat and clean syntax
Google actively supports the development of Golang. It’s the official language used at Google to build all the giant projects, and as such, it receives all the support it needs.
Since Golang is statically typed, language developers are less prone to making variable errors.
Go alerts you when you write a program without appropriate documentation
Significant performance gains due to being a compiled language (interpreted languages are a bit slower)
APIs available to test and stretch code
Static code analysis using GoMetaLinter, a handy tool
Concurrency supported, which helps programmers to build systems with a high degree of parallel processing
```
* ### The Cons

```
Developers need to code more to implement a simple feature in Golang (complex abstractions aren’t provided; while that makes Go a simple language to use, it limits its versatility)

Code reusability is more difficult in Go than in other languages since Go doesn’t support generics.
It doesn’t offer a built-in GUI library for building GUI applications (this defect means that you will need to spend significant effort to connect a library with your project)
The community has less maturity compared to some other leading programming languages.
Go consumes more computing resources for complex programs — such programs have substantial file sizes since Go doesn’t have a virtual machine (VM)

<details><summary>Java</summary>
<p>

`Java is a fast, robust, reliable and secure programming language. Moreover, Java is a “write once, run forever” language. There is no need to install different software to compile and execute Java code. Java compiler compiles Java code to byte code. This byte code can be run on a Java virtual machine (JVM) without any other software tools.`

* ### Features and use case for Java
`Java is simply used in most software developments. It is quite difficult to pinpoint where and when to use Java, specifically due to the variety of features it offers.`

```
Web based development.
Android development
Server applications in the commercial domain (trading, finance, etc.)
Implementation of software tools.
Embedded system programming.
High frequency trading spaces.
Scientific applications.
J2ME applications.
Java is used for test automation and development of Desktop GUI.
Big Data analytics .
```
* ### Pros of Java

```
Simple architecture
Java has a simple learning curve. It is easy to write, compile, debug and run Java projects. Furthermore, it is much easier to understand and work with than languages like C, C#, and C++.
Effective memory management
Java has an automatic memory allocation process. Garbage collection in Java automatically identifies memory that is no longer being used and recycles it accordingly. Therefore Java developers do not have to worry about memory management.
Java has two part in its memory; heap and stack. JVM allocates memory from either of these two when a variable is declared. It helps to reference and restore allocation easily.
Object-oriented
Java is an object oriented language. This behavior allows developers to write standard code bases as well as improves code reusability and modularity.
Platform-Independent
Java code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Therefore it can be run on any machine without installing any special software.
Multi-threading 
Java supports performing multiple tasks at the same time with concurrent programming
Secure
Java doesn’t have explicit pointers. Java programs run in a virtual machine sandbox. Furthermore, the byte code verifier checks for any security violations and also offers library-level security.
Automatic Storage Management.
```
* ### Cons of Java
```
Performance
memory consumption of Java is considerably higher, and performance is also slower than other compiled languages such as C / C++.
Works better when the code is clean and written according to the standards with straightforward logic. The entire server might get locked up in case a deadlock occurs.
Configuring Java-related tools can be hectic as there are more dependencies to be installed.
Java codes are more complex and will be hard to read and understand
Poor look 
GUI applications written in native Java do not have a good look and feel compared to other native language based GUIs
Consumption of memory
Java consumes more memory when compared to other languages such as C++ and C.
Lack of backup facility
Java mainly focuses on garbage collection and efficient memory allocation. Therefore it does not focus on keeping backup. This is a major concern of Java users.

<details><summary>Python</summary>
<p>

`Python is a high-level programming language that is mostly used for big data, artificial intelligence development, machine learning, back-end development, and scientific implementations. It has high-end data structures, libraries, and dynamic bindings, making it more suited for application development. Python has a simple syntax. Moreover, it has high readability and needs less effort for learning. Since Python is an object-oriented programming language, it offers more flexibility in programming by offering modularity and code reusability. Python uses an interpreter to convert high-level scripts into binary.`

* ### Pros of Using Python

```
Simplicity
Python has a very simple syntax that is easy to learn. Therefore it is very easy to understand the Python code. 

Use of Interpreter
Python uses an interpreter to convert python scripts to machine code. The interpreter goes through line by line when executing the code. Therefore if there is any error, the Interpreter stops the execution and throws an error. It is convenient for debugging

Supports AI development and machine learning 
Python has various inbuilt ML and AI-related libraries such as PyLEarn2, TensorFlow, Keras, and SciKit, which are invaluable for the development of complex tasks.

Multiple hosts support python.
Many cloud hosting providers such as AWS, Heroku, and Digital options offer native support for Python scripts and the flexibility to integrate with Python APIs and plugins

Community support 
Python has a very large community across the world. It is continuously developed and enhanced by the greatest software experts due to being used in most highly evolving areas.
```
* ### Cons of Using Python

```
Low speed
Python has a lower speed in terms of server-side operations compared to NodeJS and Java-based backends. One major reason for that is Python being much closer to human languages, requiring more processing to convert it to machine-readable code.

Mobile development struggle
Python is not a good option for native Android, iOS, and hybrid developments. Even though it can be achieved with some Python frameworks, we cannot expect good performance.

Naming conflicts. 
Python modules are defined by their script location. Hence there can be confusion with the names and location.

Poor memory handling 
Generally, Python can perform memory management efficiently. However, it can be slow when dealing with large systems and codebases with heavy processes.

Threading problems
Threading is not very efficient in Python. The main reason is that it has a GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which allows only a single thread to be executed at a time.

Python is case sensitive and indentation-sensitive language. It will cause more compile errors.
